# Voidforge





## About
This project is a third-party, Electron-based, modmanager for modded Minecraft, meant to be faster, and more robust than the current Curseforge client.

## Usage
Download the latest release installer, and run it on your computer.

## Contributing
Download the source, and import it as a repository to Github Desktop.  If you don't know how to do that, check my Discord server here for help.
After that I recommend installing yarn via npm install -g yarn, and using that as your package manager instead of npm.
Then in the repository just run yarn install, and it will install all of the needed packages you need for developing into a node_modules folder.
When packaging to test, just run yarn package and it will compile the code to a .exe so you can test that your changes and edits work in .exe form.

## Forking
Go ahead, just make sure that in the app itself, if you're distributing it, to credit me in some way.
