# Voidforge





## About
This project is a third-party, Electron-based, modmanager for modded Minecraft, meant to be faster, and more robust than the current Curseforge client.

## Usage
Download the latest release installer, and run it on your computer.

## Contributing
Download the source, and import it as a repository to Github Desktop.  If you don't know how to do that, check my Discord server here for help.  After that any changes you make can be uploaded as a pull request automatically, so I can view it and see if I want to add it.

## Forking
Go ahead, just make sure that in the app itself, if you're distributing it, to credit me in some way.
